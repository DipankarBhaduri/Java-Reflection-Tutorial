/**

 Annotations Detector: Write a program that scans a package for classes with a specific
 annotation and prints out their names.

 Access Enum Values: Use reflection to access and print out the values of an Enum type.

 Advanced Problems:

 Dependency Injection Framework: Create a simple dependency injection framework using reflection.
 Allow users to annotate fields in their classes to indicate dependencies, and have the framework
 inject these dependencies.

 Dynamic ORM: Build a simple Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) system that uses reflection to map
 Java objects to database tables. Implement methods for database operations like insert, update,
 and delete.

 AOP with Reflection: Implement Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) using reflection. Create aspects
 that intercept and modify method calls in other classes dynamically.

 Dynamic API Endpoint Generation: Build a REST API framework that generates API endpoints dynamically
 using reflection. Allow users to define resources with annotations, and use reflection to create
 routes and handle requests.

 Plugin System with Configurability: Extend the plugin system idea from the previous list and add
 configurability. Allow plugins to provide configuration options, and use reflection to initialize
 plugins with their specified configurations.

 Custom Serialization Format: Create a custom serialization format for objects using reflection.
 Implement your format to save and load object states, potentially in a more efficient or
 human-readable format than standard serialization.

 Class Hierarchy Analyzer: Write a program that analyzes the class hierarchy of a given class
 and provides information about its inheritance tree, interfaces implemented, and fields/methods
 inherited.

 These practice problems should offer a range of difficulty levels and cover various aspects of
 Java reflection. Make sure to start with the easier problems if you're new to reflection and
 gradually work your way up to the more advanced challenges as you become more comfortable with
 the concept.


 Enum Reflection: Explore reflection with Java Enums. Write a program that lists the values of an
 Enum and retrieves information about Enum constants using reflection.

 Analyze and Modify Annotations: Use reflection to analyze and modify annotations on classes,
 methods, or fields. You could, for example, write a program that removes or adds annotations
 at runtime.

 Dynamic Proxy: Implement a dynamic proxy using Java reflection. Create a dynamic proxy that
 intercepts method calls and performs custom actions before or after calling the original method.

 Serialization and Deserialization: Implement custom serialization and deserialization for objects
 using reflection. You can use this to save and load object states from different sources,
 like a database or file.

 Dynamic SQL Query Builder: Build a dynamic SQL query builder using reflection.
 Create a program that generates SQL queries based on object properties, allowing you to
 interact with a database more flexibly.

 Plugin System with Security: Extend the dynamic class loading idea from the previous list and add
 security checks. Only load classes that meet specific security criteria, such as classes signed
 with a particular certificate.

 Object Copy/Clone: Create a program that copies objects using reflection. This can be a deep or
 shallow copy, depending on your requirements.

 Unit Testing with Reflection: Write unit tests that use reflection to verify that your code meets
 specific requirements. This can be especially useful when testing private methods and fields.

 Classpath Scanning: Write a classpath scanner that uses reflection to scan and discover all the
 classes available in your application, categorize them, or perform specific actions based on
 class metadata.

 Custom Class Loader: Implement a custom class loader that extends or replaces the default class
 loader. This can be used for custom class loading and class version control.

 These practice problems should help you become more proficient in using Java reflection. Keep in
 mind that reflection can be powerful but should be used judiciously, as it can make your code less
 type-safe and harder to understand. It's essential to balance the benefits of reflection with the
 potential downsides.
